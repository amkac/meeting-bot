Transcript of "April team meeting":

Tom: Good afternoon, team. Let's start by reviewing our performance for the past quarter and discussing our strategy for acquiring new clients during the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. Karim, could you begin by providing an overview of our quarterly performance?

Karim: Certainly, Tom. Our team has shown promising results this quarter. We've managed to increase our assets under management by 15% and have successfully retained several key clients. However, our client acquisition numbers are not as strong as we'd like them to be.

Marie: I agree with Karim. With the Paris 2024 Olympic Games approaching, it presents us with a unique opportunity to expand our client base. We need to capitalize on this event.

Sarah: Absolutely, Marie. The Olympics will attract high-net-worth individuals and businesses from around the world to Paris. It's crucial that we position ourselves strategically to attract these potential clients.

Lionel: I suggest we focus on creating targeted marketing campaigns and leveraging our existing client network to generate referrals during this period. We should also consider hosting exclusive events or seminars for potential clients visiting Paris for the Olympics.

Tom: Those are excellent suggestions, Lionel. Let's define specific tasks to ensure we make the most of this opportunity. Karim, could you take the lead on developing a comprehensive marketing and outreach strategy for client acquisition during the Olympic Games?

Karim: Absolutely, Tom. I'll conduct market research and work on drafting a detailed plan for our team to review.

Tom: Marie, I'd like you to identify key events and networking opportunities during the Olympic Games where we can engage with potential clients.

Marie: Understood, Tom. I'll start researching and compiling a list of relevant events and activities.

Tom: Sarah, can you coordinate with our marketing team to develop engaging promotional materials and digital campaigns specifically tailored to the Olympic Games?

Sarah: Of course, Tom. I'll collaborate with the marketing team to ensure we have compelling content ready for the event.

Tom: Finally, Lionel, I want you to explore partnership opportunities with local businesses and organizations in Paris to enhance our visibility during the Games.

Lionel: Absolutely, Tom. I'll reach out to my contacts and explore potential collaborations that align with our objectives.

Tom: Fantastic. To summarize:

Karim: Develop marketing and outreach strategy for Olympic Games client acquisition.
Marie: Identify key events and networking opportunities during the Games.
Sarah: Coordinate with marketing team on promotional materials and digital campaigns.
Lionel: Explore partnership opportunities with local businesses and organizations.
Let's aim to have these tasks completed before our next meeting in two weeks. Any final thoughts before we adjourn?

Karim: No further comments from me.

Marie: I'm ready to get started, Tom.

Sarah: Likewise, Tom. I'll ensure we meet our deadlines.

Lionel: I'll dive into it right away, Tom.
